__NOTOC__
===Special:Users===

This is the actual user account info page. Accounts are one line entries that start with a bullet and are double colon separated.  The format is username::PW:email. The password is crypted so you can't change it here; neither can you change the username here because the crypt uses the username. You can change the email or delete users if you like.  You probably want to put the < !--PRIVATE--> tag in this file.  '''The starting admin password is 'admin'.'''
